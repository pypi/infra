* Consul: If the cluster loses enough instances to lose quorum (e.g. mass pod
          restart) then it will not be able to bring itself back up. This is
          because the container IPs will have changed, and without quorum
          autopilot cannot remove the broken nodes and re-add a new, healthy
          one. If/when https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/1580 gets
          resolved, this should start working automatically. Until then losing
          quorom will require human intervention.
